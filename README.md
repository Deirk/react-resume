# Comments

There are several things I wanted to do and could not do due to time issues, in the end it took me about 3 hours 15 minutes, so I will list them and tell you how I planned to do it.

## Redux

It was a bit complex because I didn't see a use for it in this exercise, but I was going to make a login with google and firebase, that would save the email and name and would be used later in the contact me.

## Contact Me

I was going to make use of the MUI inputs and the custom hook that I usually use for form handling, then I was going to implement emailJS to have a mail server and send a confirmation to the user.

## Responsive

Since I was using MUI grid I wanted to make it responsive, but I didn't have time to think about the design. I would change the columns and components, as well as the text sizes to make it responsive.

## Test

Testing, I would make use of Jest and React testing library to do the tests, create a folder outside of src and follow the same structure inside the src folder.
